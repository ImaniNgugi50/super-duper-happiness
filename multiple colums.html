Public Relations can be defined as part of marketing and communications strategy that crafts an organization’s or company’s messages to its diverse public such as to its customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, the government and the general public (Heidi Cohen,2021).  Public relations officers can communicate this message on a one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many using various channels such as owned media, social media or various other online or offline platforms. In the past few years, many social media platforms have emerged and thus these platforms have simplified the work of public relation officers by making it easier and faster to send messages to a large group of people globally.
