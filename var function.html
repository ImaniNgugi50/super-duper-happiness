<p>Public Relations can be defined as part of marketing and communications strategy that crafts an organization’s or company’s messages to its diverse public such as to its customers, employees, shareholders, suppliers, the government and the general public (Heidi Cohen,2021).  Public relations officers can communicate this message on a one-to-one, one-to-many or many-to-many using various channels such as owned media, social media or various other online or offline platforms. In the past few years, many social media platforms have emerged and thus these platforms have simplified the work of public relation officers by making it easier and faster to send messages to a large group of people globally.
In the past, these practitioners used media such as radio, newspapers or television to spread various messages and hence they had to be trained to be quite conversant with using such platforms. Unfortunately, such platforms took long to deliver messages and they proved to be quite tedious to work with as well as very expensive. The following list below shows the traditional platforms that public relation officers used in the past and their effectiveness.
